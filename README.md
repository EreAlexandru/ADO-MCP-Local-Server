# Azure DevOps MCP Server for Cursor üöÄ

**Works with Cursor!** Unlike Microsoft's official server that blocks Cursor users, this one just works.

## What is this?

A tool that lets you control Azure DevOps directly from Cursor's AI chat. Just type what you want in plain English!

## üéØ Examples of what you can say:

```
"Show my work items in project MyApp"
"Create a bug titled 'Login button broken' in project MyApp"
"List pull requests in the Frontend repository"
"Search for authentication code"
"Create a test plan for Q1 release"
```

## üì¶ Super Easy Installation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EreAlexandru/ADOMCPLocalServer.git
cd ADOMCPLocalServer
```

### Step 2: Install it

**Windows users:** Just double-click `install.bat`

**Alternative (if .bat doesn't work):** Open Command Prompt in this folder and run:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

**Mac/Linux users:** Run `./install.sh` or:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Get your Azure DevOps token
1. Go to: https://dev.azure.com/YOUR-ORG-NAME/_usersSettings/tokens
2. Click **"+ New Token"**
3. Give it a name like "Cursor"
4. Under **Scopes**, select **"Custom defined"** and check these:
   - ‚úÖ Work Items (Read, Write & Manage)
   - ‚úÖ Code (Read)
   - ‚úÖ Build (Read & Execute)
   - ‚úÖ Release (Read, Write & Execute)
   - ‚úÖ Test Management (Read & Write)
   - ‚úÖ Wiki (Read & Write)
   
   **Note:** Don't worry - the token can only do what YOU have permission to do in Azure DevOps
   
   üìñ [Why these permissions?](PERMISSIONS.md) (optional reading) 
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN NOW!** (you won't see it again)

### Step 4: Set up your credentials

**Windows users:** Just double-click `setup.bat` and enter your info

**Alternative (manual setup for Windows):**
1. Open Notepad
2. Type exactly this (replace with your values):
   ```
   AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-organization-name
   AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-token-here
   ```
3. Click File ‚Üí Save As
4. Navigate to the ADOMCPLocalServer folder
5. Change "Save as type" to **"All Files (*.*)"**
6. Type `.env` as the filename (with the dot!)
7. Click Save

**Mac/Linux users:** Create a file called `.env` in the ADOMCPLocalServer folder:
```bash
echo "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-organization-name" > .env
echo "AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-token-here" >> .env
```

### üìù How the .env file works:
- The server reads these values when it starts using `dotenv` package
- If you don't have a .env file, the server will show: "Azure DevOps PAT not found"
- The .env file is in `.gitignore` so it won't accidentally get committed
- Alternative: You can also set Windows environment variables instead of using .env

**Alternative: Using System Environment Variables (no .env needed):**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (permanent):
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG", "your-org", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT", "your-token", "User")

# Windows Command Prompt (temporary):
set AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-org
set AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-token

# Mac/Linux (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
export AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG="your-org"
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-token"
```

### Step 5: Tell Cursor where it is

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Cursor Settings**
3. Find **"Tools & Integration"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New MCP Server"** button
5. Paste this JSON (change the path to match where you cloned it):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è PATH EXAMPLES:**
- **Windows:** `"C:/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"` (use forward slashes!)
- **Mac:** `"/Users/yourname/ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js"`
- **Wrong:** `"C:\ADOMCPLocalServer\dist\index.js"` ‚ùå (backslashes don't work)

### Step 6: Restart Cursor

Close and reopen Cursor. That's it! üéâ

## üß™ Test it works

**Quick test (before opening Cursor):**
```bash
node test-connection.js
```
This will show your projects if everything is set up correctly.

**In Cursor:**
Open a new chat and type:
```
List my Azure DevOps projects
```

If you see your projects, it's working!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Windows users:** Run `check-env.bat` to diagnose issues quickly!

### "Command failed" or doesn't work
1. Did you run `npm run build`?
2. Is the path in settings.json correct?
3. Did you restart Cursor?

### "Authentication failed"
1. Is your organization name correct?
2. Is your PAT token correct?
3. Did the token expire?

### Still not working?
Check these files exist:
- `ADOMCPLocalServer/dist/index.js` 
- `ADOMCPLocalServer/.env` (or environment variables are set)

### "I don't have a .env file but it works"
You might have:
1. Set environment variables in your system already
2. Your organization allows the MCP to pass credentials differently
3. Used PowerShell/Command Prompt to set variables temporarily

To check what's set:
```bash
# Windows:
echo %AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG%
echo %AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT%

# Mac/Linux:
echo $AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG
echo $AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT
```

## üí¨ What you can ask Cursor to do

**Work Items:**
- "Show my active bugs"
- "Create a task called 'Fix homepage' in project MyApp"
- "Update work item 12345 to Done"
- "Add comment 'Fixed' to work item 12345"

**Code & PRs:**
- "Create a pull request from feature/login to main"
- "Show pull requests in MyApp"
- "Search for 'authentication' in code"

**Builds & Tests:**
- "Run build definition 123"
- "Show test results for latest build"
- "Create test plan for Sprint 5"

**And 30+ more commands!**

## üîí Is it safe?

Yes! 
- Runs only on YOUR computer
- Your token stays on YOUR computer
- No cloud servers involved
- Can only do what YOU already have permission to do in Azure DevOps
- Can't delete anything you don't have admin rights for
- Open source so you can check the code

## üìù License

MIT - Do whatever you want with it!
